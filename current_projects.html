			<h3>Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) for African Americans with Serious Mental Illness</h3>
			
			<p>People with severe and persistent mental illness such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia often have challenges with accessing health services and staying healthy. Cultural differences and discrimination can create additional health care barriers for African-Americans with serious mental illness. This curriculum was created to address these health care obstacles by involving African Americans with mental illness in all stages of the research process. We strongly believe that this approach makes for stronger research projects: projects that explore important problems and make significant changes in the community.</p>
			
			<p>This study was funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). For more information contact Project Lead, Lindsay Sheehan at lsheehan@iit.edu</p>
