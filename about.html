						"At the Illinois Institute Technology, I'm a distinguished professor of psychology and the principal investigator of the Chicago Health Disparity Center. What we've noted over the last 10 to 20 years is that people with serious mental illness will get sick and die 15 to 20 years younger than everybody else. If you are a person of color, that formula is even worse. So about ten years ago, we really wanted to tackle this issue, especially in the arena of people of color. We're in the South Side of Chicago, which is a very African American neighborhood. I'm a huge believer in ethnic health disparities and we want to develop a program to help African Americans with serious mental illness, driven by African Americans with serious mental illness. The other thing I want to tackle is stigma, which, in many ways, is in the same categories as racism, sexism, and homophobia. We're strong believers in that being led by peers. I am a peer; I've been diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder; I've been in the hospital, I took my meds this morning. And so while I am a scientist, I'm equally here as a peer of peers and that's very important to what I do."<br>- Dr. Patrick Corrigan

						"I'm a senior research associate at Illinois Tech. Our CBPR teams help us make sure that the flyers that we put out are understandable, that they're posted in the right places, that they're going to be something that people are going to be interested in doing, helping with consent forms, making sure that the language is there, that people can understand it, that it's explained in a way that will make sense, and they also help us with some of our projects."<br>- Lindsay Sheehan

						"I am a lived experience research leader. That means that the time has been taken out, that I've been given the support needed to learn about research, to learn about ethics and how to have valid scientific research, but also using my own lived experience, my own personal journey to enrich this process. Coming into this type of research from a lived experience perspective, I know that I would feel a little insecure, maybe a little overwhelmed. And so that's when I began to view maybe we should have training to develop effective lived experience research leaders, because I know that there are very intricate details and parts to this; learning how to facilitate a meeting; learning how to come up with an agenda; learning how to follow a timeline. And so we put together a second team. When we were funded, that's when it really took off; this is where we have been able to connect with other individuals that are being placed in positions of leadership on their teams. And I didn't want to be the exception; I want it to be the rule."<br>- Sonya Valentine

						"I'm a community based, participatory research team member here at IIT. When I saw the flyer for the leadership training, I was actually walking into my therapy session. When I saw the flyer on the reception deck, it was like it had my name all over it. So I called Sonya and got connected with that. It was a two day training where we learned everything from starting a meeting, how to connect with people that may be disengaged, working with people that have serious mental illness versus against them or stigmatizing them, what kind of language to use, and stuff like that. We really got some in-depth information on how to do this kind of work from people with serious mental illness that do community based work. I think it was the most important thing. The second part of the training was putting together grant proposals, so we really learned about the process of doing the bio sketch and working with other parts of the team; the researchers and also other community partners. What I loved about the training and the different things that are happening here is that people with lived experience actually have answers; they have an experience that's valuable here that in other places are not valued the same way. Even though in research, you need these people with serious mental illness or other community members to inform you about your research, they're at the bottom versus here where they're actually being a part of the full process because they have something to offer. That was the difference that made it for all of us that are here to see that we really matter."<br>- Ashley Scott

						"I am a CVPR research team leader and I am working on my fourth year, third project, fourth team. We put the manual together on how to do research and it was really kind of confusing. But as I got more involved, it became where I started to be useful in the community because a lot of times people do research, they get information, then they take off. But with this project, the manual showed how to get the organization involved and how to get the community involved. Once the community and organization are involved, they can handle their clients better and that helps the community, other than just getting all this data, snd taking off. Working on this project has definitely helped me a whole lot. It's helped me with my confidence and it's made me face some things I didn't want to face, but it's helping build a little bit of character or bringing out, not the worst in me, but the best."<br>- Scott Noble

						"I am a team research leader with lived experience and I work on one of the Pacori projects. Sonia Valentine and Lindsey saw something a little bit more in me than I saw myself. They saw that if a person with lived experience, who has been there and done it, who stayed in this turmoil with issues, then they started doing things like engaging with primary health care, clinicians, and social services, and with their consistency they came up out of it to became a more productive citizen that's more stable. My mental illness is in remission. I haven't reconnected with substance abuse. They showed me that that's something I know about that health educators, doctors, and nurses don't know and I can actually help them to engage."<br>- Julius Mercer

						"I serve on the leadership advisory board with Lindsay Sheehan and Sonia Valentine that's comprised of maybe six to eight people that are working with African American men and women that are challenged with mental illness and are looking to work on research projects that would help the communities. We will offer mentoring and coaching on a consistent basis. Mentoring, coaching, and leadership are the main topics that we talk about in our meetings; that's what we have to contribute to men and women that are on those research projects. So they get the research projects approved, we sit down and mentor them, coach them through the process, develop leadership workshops for them to attend so they can see how men and women like them are involved in leadership positions and see how they can contribute to their research projects."<br>- John R. Owens

						"My role in the project was mainly consumer team researcher. The peer navigators were the people who we interviewed. We went through the screening process. If they were eligible we helped them get a job as a peer Navigator by creating a booklet that trained them to become peer navigators. I say that with a smile because that was the best part of the research because I'm here to help people by any means possible. The training would help them get on their feet, even if it's just momentarily, however, they were more hopeful. They were happier and they did really well, so we had really good results."<br>- Marilyn Perez

						"I'm a research assistant on the BHL for African Americans with serious mental illness, with diet and exercise problems, health disparities, and things of that nature. Right now, we're running the first cohort of classes. What we did before that was we developed a manual for the peer navigators, then we develop a curriculum for the actual participants in the classes to engage in. I think we're doing the first cohort of having the classes, some with peer Navigator, some just get the classes and then others get what's called treatment, as usual, just the regular primary care doctor advice. And then we're trying to see which one is more effective. Hopefully, the cohort with the peer Navigator will be the most successful, and then we can integrate that more into more health service providers. For me, I didn't have to know much. I hadn't been in a professional environment in a number of years. Mostly, it was just having a passion to be open minded to learn more than what you already knew, to be open minded to other sources of information. For me, it was that being able to have a discussion about something I knew little about and being comfortable to say. This is my stress. This is my weaknesses. This is what I know. But by having lived experience, I don't always be able to articulate it in a way that would help. So being able to be open and getting that information on how to do it made it easier for me to transition from a consumer to what we call a prosumer. This is something that's going to move very far into the future. This is something that we're going to put a stamp on, and we're going to continue to support individuals. We're going to continue to encourage people, everyday people, to be involved in the research that will improve their quality of life. That's what this is about. It's about making connections with individuals. And I find it to be one of the highlights of my life."<br>- DeAndre Hill
