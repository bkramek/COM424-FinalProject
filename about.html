That's what we have to contribute to men and women; we sit down and mentor them, coach them through the process, develop leadership workshops for them to attend so they can see how men and women like them are involved in leadership positions and see how they can contribute."<br>- John R.

						"I didn't have to know much. I hadn't been in a professional environment for a number of years. Mostly, it was just having a passion to be open minded to learn more than what you already knew. We're going to continue to encourage people, everyday people, to be involved in the research that will improve their quality of life. That's what this is about. It's about making connections with individuals. And I find it to be one of the highlights of my life."<br>- DeAndre Hill<br>
